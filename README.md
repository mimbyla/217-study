# 217-study
My explorations of census data and visualization for the area around Urbana, IL. 

In my initial project proposal I identified a tutorial ( “Beginner’s guide to build data visualizations on the web with D3”) that 
planned to use to both better understand programming on the web and create a graph of the poverty rate in Urbana using census data. I was
able to do both of these things, although with some variation in tools and a much simpler dataset than I initially imagined. 

## How to Navigate this Project

The narrative uploaded in the class moodle is the best way to navigate this git-hub page. It includes a guide to all of the files 
uploaded here and when they were created or used in the process of my learning.
